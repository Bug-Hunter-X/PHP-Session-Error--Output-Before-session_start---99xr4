The solution is simple: always call `session_start()` before any output is sent to the browser.

```php
<?php
session_start(); // session_start() called before any output
// ...rest of session handling code...
?>
```

It is recommended to place `session_start()` at the very beginning of your script, before any HTML or other output is sent.  If you have headers already sent, you might receive an error that prevents you from starting the session. Ensure the file has no extra characters before the opening `<?php` tag.
