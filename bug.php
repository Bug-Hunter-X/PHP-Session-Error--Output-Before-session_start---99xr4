This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP when working with sessions: not properly initializing the session.  The session_start() function must be called before any output is sent to the browser. If output is sent before the session starts, the session may not be properly initialized, leading to unpredictable results.

```php
<?php
echo "This line sends output before session_start();"; // Error: Output sent before session start
session_start();
// ...rest of session handling code...
?>
```
